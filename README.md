- npm i ;
- npm run migrate;
- npm run seed ;
- npm run dev;

- db is combined with omdb api ,firstly it seeds  data from omdb api  for users
- after that it every time checks if in db there are any changes and then returns films
- this aproach allows to have all films and also edit/delete it for specific user ,
